partyq is a music queue app that uses Spotify to play music. If one person has Spotify premium (and the Spotify app on their device) they can use partyq to host a music party for a group of people with partyq who don't have Spotify (and are nearby/connected to the same wifi). Everyone connected to the party can search for and add songs to a shared queue, while the host device plays the music using Spotify.
    
Note that many of the Spotify API and AppRemote endpoints that this app depends on are in beta and are subject to change without warning.
