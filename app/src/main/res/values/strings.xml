Make sure that you have granted partyq all the required permissions, have downloaded the Spotify app on this device, and are logged into it with a Spotify Premium account. Please try again after checking each requirement.</string>
    <string name="denied_permissions_msg">The partyq app uses Bluetooth and/or local Wifi to connect everyone in the party and exchange data.

    <string name="no_spotify_premium_msg">We noticed that the Spotify account logged into your Spotify app isn\'t premium. The partyq app relies on the Spotify app to play specific songs and, unfortunately, Spotify free doesn\'t let you play specific songs at will (if you tried, it would instead play a random song).
