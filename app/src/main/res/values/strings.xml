    <!-- About -->
    <string name="about_title">About partyq</string>
    <string name="about_basic_content">The partyq app lets you and a group of friends use Spotify to listen to and add music from a shared queue that only people in the party have access to. The special thing about partyq is that only one person (the host) needs to have Spotify Premium in order for everyone to be able to use it! partyq is the high-tech equivalent of passing your phone around for people to add songs to your Spotify queue.</string>
    <string name="about_tech_details_title">Technical Details</string>
    <string name="about_tech_details_content">The partyq app plays music by connecting to the Spotify app downloaded on the host’s device and simply telling Spotify to play the specific songs in the queue. This requires a Spotify Premium account because Spotify Free users can’t play specific songs; they can only play random songs by the same artist, or in the same genre as the song they really want to listen to.\n\nFor guests to perform an action, like add a song request to the queue, guests send their request to the host for them to execute on their Spotify account. All the guests connect to the host’s device via Bluetooth or wifi, so you need to be either connected to the same wifi as your host or physically within ~10 meters to be able to send and receive data as intended. This Bluetooth/wifi connection requires you to grant wifi, Bluetooth, and location privileges to the partyq app. Location privileges are unintuitively required not because partyq uses your location in any way, but because your location could potentially be obtained from data that is used to achieve a wifi device connection. Without any one of these permissions, partyq would be unable to connect your device to any others.</string>
    <string name="about_contrib_title">Contributing</string>
    <string name="about_contrib_content">The partyq app is open source under the Apache-2.0 license! That means that if you want to report an issue, contribute to the app, suggest new features, or just look at the code, you can do it all on the partyq GitHub page: https://github.com/niehusst/partyq</string>

    <!-- Remediation -->
    <string name="generic_error_msg">Something seems to have gone wrong connecting you to the party. Make sure that you have granted partyq all the required permissions, have downloaded the Spotify app on this device, and are logged into it with a Spotify Premium account. Please try again after checking each requirement.</string>
    <string name="denied_permissions_msg">The partyq app uses Bluetooth and/or local Wifi to connect everyone in the party and exchange data. In order to accomplish this connection, partyq requires Wifi, Bluetooth, and (unintuitively) Location permissions. Please come back after granting the missing permissions in the Settings app or by retrying your last action.</string>
    <string name="no_spotify_premium_msg">We noticed that the Spotify account logged into your Spotify app isn\'t premium. The partyq app relies on the Spotify app to play specific songs and, unfortunately, Spotify free doesn\'t let you play specific songs at will (if you tried, it would instead play a random song). Please come back after logging into a Spotify Premium account in your Spotify app.</string>
    <string name="no_spotify_msg">The partyq app relies on the Spotify app to play music; if you don\'t have the Spotify app installed (and are logged in with a premium account) then you can\'t play any music!
