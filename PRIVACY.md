# Privacy Policy
#### Last updated 3/2/2021

The partyq app does not keep, share, or sell any of your Spotify data or personal data. All data accessed is only used within the context of the app to perform the necessary functions and is immediately released when no longer needed.

### Spotify Data

By authenticating with Spotify, partyq gains access to: the host's Spotify application for streaming music, reading the host's playlist, and whether or not the host has Spotify Premium.
* When the host authenticates with Spotify while starting a party, partyq gets back an OAuth token that is used only for authenticating search requests and checking if the user has Spotify premium. This token is never shared with any other user of the app and is erased and invalidated when the host ends the party or when the host fully closes the app (whichever happens first).
* Guests don't have any Spotify data (that partyq is aware of, anyway) and do not gain access to any by connecting to the host.

A host could deny partyq access to their Spotify data, but that would mean canceling the authentication with Spotify and thus preventing partyq from being able to connect to Spotify for music playing.

The code for handling the host's OAuth token is located in the [TokenHandlerService](https://github.com/niehusst/partyq/blob/main/app/src/main/java/com/niehusst/partyq/services/TokenHandlerService.kt) if you wish to examine it for yourself.

### Other User Data

partyq saves the following data in a local file only accessible by the partyq app (shared preferences): 
* the 4 digit code of the current/last party the user joined
* whether the user is the host of the current party
* whether the user has just joined the party

### App Analytics

We also utilize select third-party vendors (Google Analytics) to allow tracking technologies on the partyq application to analyze and track users' use of the application, determine the popularity of certain content and better understand user activity. By accessing the partyq mobile app, you consent to the collection and use of your information by these third-party vendors. You are encouraged to review their privacy policy and contact them directly for responses to your questions. We do not transfer personal information to these third-party vendors. Any additional advertising features offered by these third-party vendors are not used in any way.

### Permissions

partyq uses a number of permissions, all with the sole purpose of connecting you to the party host/your guests.
* Bluetooth permissions: so partyq can create a Bluetooth connection between devices for exchanging party data
* Wifi permissions: so partyq can create a Wifi connection between devices for exchanging party data
* Fine and Coarse location permissions: partyq does **NOT** use or collect user location data in any way. This permission is only required for the purpose of scanning for Bluetooth and Wifi connections. For more information on why this is, see this [Android documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/bluetooth-le#permissions).

You could deny these permissions, but without them, the app is unable to perform necessary functions (i.e. exchanging party data between host and guests).

No other user data is recorded or collected, and none of it is shared with anyone, including developers.

### Changes to this policy

We will continue to update our policies and practices as needed. We will notify you of any changes to our Privacy Policy by posting any changes here. If we do, youâ€™ll see that the date at the top of this Privacy Policy has changed.
